      <p id="description">Hello my name is Jasmine Wong! I am a fifth year studying Data Science and Business.
        I love pandas and coding! But since this website is made using code, I'll just tell you about the pandas part of the equation.
        Pandas are native to China and are known for their distinctive black-and-white coloring. 
        They primarily eat bamboo and spend most of their day eating and resting (up to fourteen hours a day)! 
        Even though they look cuddly, they're actually strong climbers and excellent swimmers. 
        Interestingly, pandas have a special wrist bone that acts like a thumb, helping them hold bamboo while they eat. 
        Baby pandas are born tiny and pink, weighing only about three ounces, which is roughly the size of a stick of butter. 
        Over time, they grow into the fluffy, gentle giants we all recognize. I had the pleasure of seeing a couple when I visited Chengdu, China.
        Pandas are one of my favorite animals because they are playful, calm, and surprisingly expressive. 
        I have always found it fascinating how they can spend hours eating bamboo or rolling down a hill without a care in the world. 
        They remind me to slow down and enjoy the process. When I am working on a project, I like finding small moments of joy in problem-solving, just like a panda enjoying his afternoon snack.
